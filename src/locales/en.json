    "description": "In a quiet corner of Vironas, we created a small coffee shop. It was born from a personal love: coffee, healthy nutrition, and the aromas of Greek soil. The idea started with something simple yet real: the dried fig from the Taxiararchos of Evoia. A small fruit filled with memories, taste, and care, just as we want our coffee to be. Here, every snack and every cup has a reason for existence. They are made with care, a love for nature, and the belief that everyday life can have authentic flavor. Come for a coffee, a moment of relaxation, a small escape."
